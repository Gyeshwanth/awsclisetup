## Setting Up a Cron Job for AWS Resource Monitoring Script

### View Existing Cron Jobs
To view your current user's cron jobs:
```bash
crontab -l
```

### Create or Edit a Cron Job
To create a new cron job or edit existing ones:
```bash
crontab -e
```

This opens the crontab file in your default editor (e.g., GNU nano).

### Writing a Cron Expression
To run your shell script every 1 minute, add the following line to the crontab:
```bash
* * * * * /full/path/to/aws_resource_monitor.sh
```

### Get Full Path to Your Script
To find the full path of your shell script:
```bash
readlink -f aws_resource_monitor.sh
```
Use the output in the crontab line.

### Save and Exit in GNU Nano
1. Press `Ctrl + O` to save
2. Press `Enter` to confirm
3. Press `Ctrl + X` to exit

### Verify the Cron Job
After saving, confirm the cron job is installed:
```bash
crontab -l
```

### Stop or Remove the Cron Job
- To **stop** the job, comment out the line by adding `#` at the beginning:
  ```bash
  # * * * * * /full/path/to/aws_resource_monitor.sh
  ```
- Or, delete the line entirely from `crontab -e` and save.

You're all set to run your AWS resource monitoring script automatically every minute!
